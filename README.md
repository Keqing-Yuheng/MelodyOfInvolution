# MelodyOfInvolution
A music game with extreme complexity running in the console.
一个难度极高的音游(在控制台中运行)
## Attention
1.As a learner, I cannot do very vell in programming. Thus, the source code of the project might NOT deserve to be read, for it is neither extraordinary nor easy for reading. If you just want to read the code so as to know how the game exactly works, that is OK. However, I still think the method of playing is good(At least it will be better after several updates).
作为一个初学者，我进行开发的能力有限。因此，该项目的源代码并不值得阅读，因为源代码既不包含先进的技术，也不易于阅读。如果阅读源代码的目的只是知道这个程序是怎么运行起来的，那么是可以的。但即使如此，我还是相信这个游戏的玩法是可以的，至少在几个版本后会变好。

## Info
The brunch Res-v1 contains MOI resources, whose standard is MOI R1.1 Format.  

**Attention**
- Due to the copyright of music, resources only contain online music links and they do NOT contain offline music files. When you open a MOI project, MOI will open a web page of the music with your default browser(if Mute Mode is disabled), on which you can play the music.  
- Edit the line 3 of a MOI Project file(*.txt), fill it with other URL or path, and you can switch the source of music playing.  
- MOI R1.1 Format will be deprecated in later versions. At that time, MOI will publish a format converter and stop publish resources in old standards.

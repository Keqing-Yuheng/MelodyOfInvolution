## Quick Start
Run `Launcher - Melody Of Involution.exe` and then Melody Of Involution is launched.  
Despite the fact that you can run `MelodyOfInvolution.exe` to launch the game directly, you may encounter more problems, like adjusting the window size manually and display problem.  
## Development
`Visual Studio 2013 - Windows XP (v120_xp)` is used. Changing the config to another one, such as `v143`, may cause unexpected problems.
